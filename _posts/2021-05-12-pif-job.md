As of October 2020, I've joined the
[White House Presidential Innovation Fellows](https://pif.gov){:target="_blank"}
2021 cohort as an Entrepreneur in Residence with the Department of Labor's
Office of Disability Employment policy,
where I work on developing protocols to help ensure that HR-related AI tools
are not unintentionally biased against job seekers and employees with disabilities.

>Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) pairs industry's top technologists, designers, and strategists with federal changemakers to co-create bold solutions for public good. Embedded within agencies as “entrepreneurs in residence” for one year, our fellows bring the best of data science, design, engineering, product, and systems thinking into government.
