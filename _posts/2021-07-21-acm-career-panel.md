I'm on a panel with several other awesome folks organized by ACM and ACM Chicago-
[Careers: Riding the Rapids of Change](https://www.meetup.com/acm-chicago/events/278868592/){:target="_blank"}.

Event: Wednesday, July 21st online, 7:00-8:00 PM Eastern

Summary from the event website:
> How do we thrive, rather than just survive, in a field of work that constantly pushes ahead in new directions? To try to answer that question this meeting opens the “floor” where everyone can talk about:
> * How to stay relevant,
* Adapting to change in technology and organizations,
* Using social and professional networks,
* And when to make a total career change

Update:

The panel recording is available on the ACM Chicago's Channel on YouTube:
