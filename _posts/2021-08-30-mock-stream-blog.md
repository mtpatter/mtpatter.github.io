I've got a new blog post published in the Towards Data Science publication on Medium.
Find a friend link (no paywall) here:
[Make a mock “real-time” data stream with Python and Kafka](https://towardsdatascience.com/make-a-mock-real-time-stream-of-data-with-python-and-kafka-7e5e23123582?sk=7ccd7b3383969c2b52c6606c12054c32){:target="_blank"}.

A GitHub repo with all code is available online here: [mtpatter/time-series-kafka-demo](https://github.com/mtpatter/time-series-kafka-demo){:target="_blank"}.

If you find any of it useful and want to let me know, I always appreciate donations to my Saturday morning fancy coffee fund:
