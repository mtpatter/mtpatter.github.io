I am currently a second term [White House Presidential Innovation Fellow](http://pif.gov){:target="_blank"}, detailed to the U.S. Department of Labor as an Entrepreneur-in-Residence and AI subject matter expert. My charge is leading the development of a responsible AI framework for adopting emerging tech with a pilot project reviewing AI's potential for helping veterans transition to civilian employment equitably. I am also a co-lead for the Federal government's AI Community of Practice working group on Responsible AI.

Prior to civic tech, I led data science at [High Alpha Innovation](https://www.highalphainno.com/){:target="_blank"}, partnering with corporations and organizations to innovate through startup and venture studio creation. In addition to supporting software startups from ideation to launch, I also designed data product roadmaps, architected cloud-based data science and analysis pipelines, and developed machine learning models for early to late stage startups to equip them with AI.

In the academic and research sciences, I've driven innovation and modernization efforts through the adoption of scalable emerging technology for several large scale projects. I led the design and development of petabyte-scale data platforms and real-time streaming analytics systems for NASA, NOAA, the Zwicky Transient Facility astronomy collaboration, and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (Vera C. Rubin Observatory).

I have a strong interest in AI for good, civic tech, open and reproducible science, and diversity and inclusion in the workplace and especially in STEM fields. I'm listed as a resource in the 500 women scientists' [request-a-scientist](https://gage.500womenscientists.org/profile/8442){:target="_blank"} database, if you are looking for someone with my background for panels, conferences, or interviews.

In general, I am interested in high-impact and inclusive applications of emerging tech. When I'm not in front of the computer, you might find me out for a long run or at a baseball game.  Go Cubs!
