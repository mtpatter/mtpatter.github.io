I am currently a [White House Presidential Innovation Fellow](http://pif.gov){:target="_blank"}, detailed as an Entrepreneur-in-Residence to the U.S. Department of Laborâ€™s Office of Disability Employment Policy. I'm working on developing protocols to help ensure HR-related AI tools are not unintentionally biased against job seekers and employees with disabilities.

Prior to civic tech, I was a Senior Data Scientist at [High Alpha Innovation](https://www.highalphainno.com/){:target="_blank"},
where I helped with data and analytic strategies for corporate innovation through startup creation.  I also designed data products, architected cloud-based data science and analysis pipelines, and developed machine learning models to help launch software startups and equip them with AI.

I've led the development of large-scale (terabyte to petabyte) technical data platforms and real-time streaming analytics systems for scientists with NASA, NOAA, the Zwicky Transient Facility astronomy collaboration, and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (now the Vera C. Rubin Observatory).

I have a strong interest in AI for good, civic tech, open and reproducible science, and diversity and inclusion in the workplace and especially in STEM fields. I'm listed as a resource in the 500 women scientists' [request-a-scientist](https://gage.500womenscientists.org/profile/8442){:target="_blank"} database, if you are looking for someone with my background for panels, conferences, or interviews.

In general, I am interested in new data science tools and techniques and ways I can contribute to data-intensive projects in high-impact applications. When I'm not in front of the computer, you might find me out for a long run or at a baseball game.  Go Cubs!
